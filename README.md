# Loader

This repository provides the [JavaScript Loader specification](http://tc39.github.io/loader).
This consolidates work on the ECMAScript module loading semantics with the integration
points of Web browsers, as well as Node.js.

# Building

Building the specification requires [Bikeshed](http://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed).
First make sure to [install Bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed/blob/master/docs/install.md)
and then build the spec by running make. The output will be in `out/index.html`.
